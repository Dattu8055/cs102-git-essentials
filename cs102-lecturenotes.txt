 firstly we go to the home folder, and type "ssh -keygen -t RSA" to connect to the GitHub application
then in it got to the (id_rsa.pub) file and then copy the RSA key and then paste it into the GitHub ssh settings page to
let GitHub connect to our machine so that we can use only git for the repository editing.
then we went to the GitHub folder and created a cs102-git essentials file in it and by using "git add cs102-git-essentials.txt" command 
we saved it. then using the command "git status" we can see that file is not committed, then use the "git commit -m file.exe" command
we can see it committed then push it to main by using "git push file.exe"
then we see all the previous versions of that repository by using the command "git log".
